/*
A Promise is in one of these states:

- pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
- fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
- rejected: meaning that the operation failed.


As the Promise.prototype.then() and Promise.prototype.catch() methods return promises, they can be chained.
